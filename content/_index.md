{{< todo >}}Everything! Maypop is an ongoing project; right now, we're still halfway through
the school term! At the time of writing, we have completed only a handful of our goals
for the language; stay tuned to see more!{{< /todo >}}

Hi, and weclome to Maypop! This site is a little bit of an experiment - we're implementing
a dependently typed language entirely using Literate Haskell. The idea is to guide users
through our code using a narrative, instead of just throwing a completed repository at them.
With that out of the way, feel free to look around the available modules!
