Hi, and weclome to Maypop! This site is a little bit of an experiment - we're implementing
a dependently typed language entirely using Literate Haskell. The idea is to guide users
through our code using a narrative, instead of just throwing a completed repository at them.
With that out of the way, feel free to look around the available modules!
