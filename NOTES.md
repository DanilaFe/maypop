* I think the Calculus of Inductive Constructions sounds solid. I don't know what the difference between most dependently typed systems is, though.
* Possible "stretch" features
    * "Notation"-like mechanism to specify custom n-ary operators. Something like Agda's maybe?
    * Reimplement and verify the language in itself.
    * Module system? Either advanced (OCaml-like) or basic (just imports etc)
* I'm messing around with various ideas that Eric suggested. Check out `misc/ExtensibleExpr.lhs`, for instance.
